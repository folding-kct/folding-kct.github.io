### Join the KCT Folding@home team!

Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a distributed computing project for disease research that simulates protein folding, computational drug design, and other types of molecular dynamics.  

The project is using the idle resources of personal computers owned by volunteers from all over the world to study the process of how proteins assemble themselves in order to develop therapies to combat illnesses.  

Join this project and donate your computing power to the KCT Folding@home team and help further the noble cause of science.
