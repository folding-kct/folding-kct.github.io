## What is Folding@home?
Folding@home is a distributed computing project that’s been around since the year 2000. It’s named after “protein folding.” If you install the software and join a project, it will run in the background and use spare graphics processing (GPU) power to run calculations. Your PC will be one of the hundreds of thousands of PCs running these calculations, all working together.

The software has previously been used to help find cures to cancer, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, influenza, and many other diseases. Now, Folding@home is helping scientists understand the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.

## How it works
In simple words, you can put your PC’s CPU and GPU to work on crunching numbers that will help scientists better understand and fight the novel coronavirus. Your computer will be one of hundreds of thousands of others on the same distributed global network - all working on computational tasks to help further the cause of scientific research for medicine.

You can read specifics about how Folding@home is “simulating the dynamics of COVID-19 proteins to hunt for new therapeutic opportunities” on the [project’s website.](https://foldingathome.org)

## What we are doing to help
A folding team (a group of computers under a common badge) has been created on behalf of the Kumaraguru Institutions to do our part in finding cures for diseases.

The team is currently functional with a few students contributing their PC’s for this cause as a pilot initiative.

All students studying in the Kumaraguru Institutions are requested to support the cause and contribute their PC’s idle time under the team Folding@KCT. You can [get started here](/getting-started)

## Why you should contribute
As students, we don’t always use our computers’ at full power.  
You would help scientists in finding cures by choosing to donate a portion of the resources that remain unused.

This doesn’t require you to have high-performance machines to contribute, it is the idea that counts.  
**Remember, every small contribution goes a long way in saving lives.**

This is a chance for you to be a global citizen and give back to the community. Additionally, the Folding@KCT team’s leaderboard encourages healthy competition between students and the highest contributing students will be rewarded.
