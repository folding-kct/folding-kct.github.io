### Does Folding@home affect system performance?
Folding@Home can run as a low-priority process . The effect on real-world system performance is kept to a minimum.

### I don't see my progress on the [leaderboard](/stats)
Not to worry. Your contributions only start showing up on the [leaderboard](/stats) after you've finished your first work unit. With time, you can build up your points and move up the rankings on the leaderboard!

### Who "owns" the results?
Folding@home is run by an academic institution (specifically the Pande Group, at Stanford Universityâ€™s Chemistry Department), which is a nonprofit institution dedicated to science research and education.
